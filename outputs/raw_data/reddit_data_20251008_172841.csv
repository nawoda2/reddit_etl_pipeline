1o0xmzn,Does the value of Rui Hachimura's shooting offset his defensive clumsiness and clunkiness with the way this team is constructed?,"I'm asking this because....for one, yes, I'm going to continue to ring the bell on Marcus Smart being a starter and to me, that should be even more clear now than it was a week ago. Some of the issues the Lakers have defensively basically are not salvageable unless Smart starts. He's the one player who could potentially salvage those issues with his size/ability as a POA defender and versatility.

But I am also asking this because as hard as Rui tries, and he is a good defender against forwards his size. He defends bigger forwards well. But he struggles with defensive awareness and he isn't the best when he's being forced to defend down the lineup. That hasn't changed and likely never will. He's become a passable overall defender, but his weaknesses defensively are magnified with this group, which is in part why the Lakers were a pretty damn bad defensive group last year with he and AR/Bron/Luka on the floor together.

Yeah, the offense could make up for it, but is that a championship winning collective? Does Smart really bog down the offense that much? I don't think he does.

But this isn't a Marcus Smart post specifically. It's a Rui one, and it isn't a bashing post, but I do wanna know whether you all think what Rui does offer this ballclub as a starter, particularly, offsets his blase defense. What do you think Rui's value is to this team with how it is currently constructed.",RVALover4Life,lakers,0,29,2025-10-08 01:38:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1o0xmzn/does_the_value_of_rui_hachimuras_shooting_offset/,0.45,False,False,False,False
