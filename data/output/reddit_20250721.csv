1m4sfz5,Marcus Smart is the perfect vet for Bronny,"Since Gary Payton won DPOY in the 1995-96 season, only one guard has won that award - Marcus Smart in 2021-22. 

Smart was an absolute defensive menace that year, drawing charges, diving for balls, cheeky steals off of inbounds passes - just totally disruptive. Since Bronny seems to have embraced the idea that defense is the best way for him to impact winning at this point in his career, this seems like a perfect signing for Bronny‚Äôs development even if Smart is past his prime. Him and Jrue holiday have probably been the two best defensive guards of the last 15 years, and so the fact that we scooped one of them is pretty sick. 

The other thing we maybe should think about to is our other guards who need to get better defensively (ar, Luka). Even though Luka is already a certified superstar, he‚Äôs still young with plenty of room to grow, and if he takes the defensive challenge seriously, he could benefit from having Marcus around to learn a few things. Same can be said for Reaves. 

Overall seems like a great signing even if he doesn‚Äôt get a ton of minutes just from the team experience/mentorship slot.

1m4btsi,I honestly think we're a chip contender now,"So here's my thinking, we have a good chance of winning a championship this year if everyone stays healthy and motivated. I'd love to hear your opinion in the comments.

Luka : We literally have luka freakin doncic, who is known to preform and hustle even when injured. He can make teammates around him better and has already carried the mavs to the finals, and to the wcf when they were worse. 

Lebron : Despite his age, he is still a top 10 player in the league and will most likely still perform amazing this year. 

Austin : An amazing regular season player thar has improved immensely, if he manages to keep it on this level and later on pushes hard in the playoffs he will make a difference. 

Rui : A great 3&D, i love him more every season and i think he brings alot to the table. 

Ayton : While he is known to have poor motivation and motor, he will now play alongside luka, that will make him better and love playing again. He was awesome with CP3 and i think he can do that again, on another level even. 

Marcus : Great player, much needed defender, if he stays healthy he'll bring fire to the floor. 

Laravia : Young, with much more room to grow and a great guard addition, almost on the same level as DFS. 

Bronny : Has improved alot this year and will continue to grow. If he succeeds in being a defensive pest and improving his shot he will add something meaningful to the team, subbing out for 10 minutes/night. 

Hayes : Great backup, ayton will be taking his minutes so as a C rotation he will perform to the level that is expected of a backup C. 

Adou : Athletic freak, could be a great 3&D once his shot settles from the growth spurt. Feeling confident in him.

The others i don't really believe in much anymore, that's why a trade to extend bench deepth is needed. But i still honestly think we can do something big, with this year's additions.

1m4nwpe,For those of you who still feel there‚Äôs more to be done; what would you do if you‚Äôre Rob via trade to finish off building this roster?,"This team is in a very unique scenario because they‚Äôve acquired smart, ayton, and laravia and given up none of the assets.  Personally I‚Äôm pretty happy with where the roster sits right now, but I think there‚Äôs very clearly room to improve further.

You‚Äôre sitting on about 20 mill of expiring salary between Gabe/maxi, 17 mill of positive expiring salary with rui, 12 mill for 3 more years of negative salary in Vando, a tradeable asset in dalton, and the 2031 first plus swaps.

Now I personally think the best possible trade the lakers could make would be attaching dalton as the asset to any combo of vando/maxi/gabe in exchange for a real contributor, but there are endless other moves because in total the lakers have like 50+ mill of salary they wouldn‚Äôt mind moving between the group of players I named. 

I‚Äôll list a few trades that I think would make a ton of sense, let me know what ideas you‚Äôve come up with if you think there‚Äôs still a move to make before next season.

1. Wiggins for dalton/kleber/gabe

-no picks, I am firmly against trading draft capital for Wiggins. Miami gets a promising young scoring wing and about 20 mill of expiring salary so they can be active in the summer of ‚Äò26, lakers get Wiggins.  

2. Ayo dosunmu/Julian Phillips for vando/dalton and 2031 first 

-this may seem like a lot up front but I think it would be well worth it.  Ayo is exactly the mold of long term player you want next to Luka.  Versatile young all around defensive guard-wing.  The reason you give up dalton and the first is because this trade gets you off vandos long term money, which is a huge cap relief now and in the future.  It‚Äôs a two fold trade that solves two different things. On the bulls side they get a good young prospect and a first for a guy who had a down year last year and will have to get paid soon 

3. Gabe/dalton/maxi for thybulle/robert Williams/2 2nds

-from Portland‚Äôs perspective, neither Williams or thybulle are in their rotation next year so they‚Äôre basically just swapping expiring salary for expiring salary with dalton as the incentive.  From the lakers side you pay the price of dalton in exchange for two significantly higher upside swings vs kleber/gabe in Robert Williams and thybulle, and recoup a couple second round picks in the process 

Honorable mention: I think there‚Äôs actually a pretty solid path to a grimes sign and trade around rui, not exactly sure how it would have to shake out but I‚Äôve had that one in the back of my mind for awhile, makes sense for both teams 

Thoughts? Any other ideas?

1m4ov7p,Not every player on our roster needs to be a playoff contributor to have value,"

Seeing a lot of discussion on players we need or don't need soley based on their value in the playoffs. It seems people are okay getting rid of some players if they aren't going to be a rotation guy in the playoffs.

It's a long season and before getting to the playoffs, our goal should be to get a top seed. Having depth and reliable players with energy are so important. Weathering stretches of the season when we have injuries will be key to to getting that top season. Not every game is going to be against top tier teams, with time to scheme against us. We'll be playing teams like the Wizards and Hornets as well.

We had moments where guys like Hayes and Knecht were huge contributors during the regular season. Hayes even had a stretch when we thought we might re-sign him to be our starting center. He's going to be a perfectly serviceable backup during the regular season. Jordan Goodwin was also someone that offered great value as a backup role player offering minutes when we had injuries. 

When evaluating our team, we shouldn't be looking at every guy as ""can they make the playoff rotation?"". As long as we have a balanced 8-man roster for the playoffs, we can have an un-balanced regular season roster for our backups. We just need guys who are good value that plan to work hard.",darth_elevator_,lakers,5,33,2025-07-20 13:25:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m4ov7p/not_every_player_on_our_roster_needs_to_be_a/,0.59,False,False,False,False

1m4krjt,Thoughts on switching Reaves to the 6th man?,"Following the Marcus Smart acquisition, what are your thoughts on starting him at the 2 to provide more defense in the starting lineup (which is very much needs), and then having Austin Reaves come off the bench as an offensive spark, that can help facilitate the offense with Bron/Luka, Hayes, Vincent/LaRavia and Vanderbilt.

Also wanted to throw in a little extra question; if we keep Goodwin, where do you see his role on the team?",BigChigger,lakers,0,55,2025-07-20 09:31:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m4krjt/thoughts_on_switching_reaves_to_the_6th_man/,0.45,False,False,False,False

1m4kspq,Ben Simmons as low usage guard/wing?,"Listening to Lakers Nation show and Trevor mentioned Ben Simmons as an available free agent.

It‚Äôs the summer of reclamation projects. The last 2 signings have been talented players that bring a skillset specifically suited for Luka. Simmons is intriguing because he adds to the athletic profile of the team but doesn‚Äôt need many minutes at this point in his career. The lakers are trying to maximize talent and potential while not giving up too many assets. 

I think we‚Äôll make another trade for a solid rotation player or two that make sense. But I think the idea of Simmons addresses some needs on the back end of the roster. Sure, like always, it‚Äôs THE IDEA of Ben Simmons that fools us every year, but factoring in a very utility-based role and the lakers‚Äô ‚Äúbuy low‚Äù mentality this offseason it makes some sense. Get a couple former high-pick players that could help in the next couple years then clear the books. 

I look at the profile more than the player since it‚Äôs a back-end roster spot. Big athlete with ball handling skills that has a shot at defending big wings. 


Edit: I would even say he‚Äôs better offensively than Vando due to playmaking skill. Maybe we‚Äôd only be able to handle one negative offensive player in the rotation tho so Vando‚Äôs negative trade value sucks.",N0waaay23,lakers,0,37,2025-07-20 09:33:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m4kspq/ben_simmons_as_low_usage_guardwing/,0.34,False,False,False,False

1m4nacj,I honestly can't tell if this season is gonna be great or literally awful.,"I think the ceiling is a chance to win it all, not the favorite but in the mix....

  
However, I just...Deandre ayton has a real shot at being awful. Two teams literally paid money to be rid of him.

Lebron is 41 and had a lot going on last year, lowest plus minus on ENTIRE TEAM, When intensity ramped up he got injured 3x back to back.

DFS was just so good for us....Literally our best role player. Remember how shit we were before we got him?

 Our bench seems like it could be really, really shit this year.

The main thing, is I think we're gonna get a legit monster luka season. And than get fucked by depth when it matters and lebron not holding up.

1m4jmve,Who COULD we trade for?,"I personally see 3 realistic trade scenarios and one super unlikely one:

1: DILLON BROOKS

Trade: Rui, Knecht, + 2nd


2: ANDREW WIGGINS

Trade: Rui, Vincent, 2nd


3: MATISSE THYBULLE

Trade: Vincent, multiple 2nds


4: JERAMI GRANT (UNLIKELY)

Trade: Rui, Vincent, Knecht for Jerami Grant + 2nd.


Would absolutely love to get Dillon Brooks on this squad.... His attitude and defense would be amazing. Sometimes gets hot from 3pt too

Am I overvaluing/undervaluing any of the players involved here?

1m4xfs9,Nothing against LeBron but having Luka be the face of the team is such a relief,"Anthony Davis couldn‚Äôt do it. The both of them struggled to recruit and we put a lot of blame on Pelinka (rightfully so at times..) but at the end of the day Lebron and AD couldn‚Äô recruit. 

Luka‚Äôs first offseason he was able to get Ayton, Smart, and LaRavia for nothing just from recruiting. 

Luka also seems smarter at knowing what type of players he wants to play with(talent scouting) while LeBron goes out and recruits ‚ÄúM.U.D‚Äù and Russel Westbrook.

I have confidence that Pelinka AND Luka can bring us a championship.

1m4o8ne,Lakers going to be a 1st apron team,"In order to sign Marcus Smart and stay under the 1st apron the Lakers have to waive Shake Milton and Jordan Goodwin. This would free up enough cap room to stay under.

Here is the problem though. By signing Smart and releasing these 2 players it leaves the Lakers with 14  players with NBA contracts. NBA says you have to have 15 or you get charged the incomplete roster charge which is vet minimum. That amount would still put the Lakers over the 1st apron.

The other problem I am seeing is Thiero's money is not even calculated into this yet so it may be even worse.

Teams over the first apron face significant restrictions, including:
Losing access to the full mid-level exception and the bi-annual exception. 
Inability to acquire players via sign-and-trade. 
Limitations on trades, including not being able to send out more than 100% in salary matching and restrictions on using prior year trade exceptions. 
Inability to sign waived players with a salary above the mid-level exception amount. 

So maybe Rob can work some magical numbers and somehow get the Lakers under the 1st apron without having to mess the roster up to badly. We will see.",scifier2,lakers,0,16,2025-07-20 12:55:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m4o8ne/lakers_going_to_be_a_1st_apron_team/,0.14,False,False,False,False
