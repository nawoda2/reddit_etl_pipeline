1m6eqz1,(Free to Read): Luka Donƒçiƒá recruiting for Lakers ahead of contract extension decision,"[Read for free here.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6504138/2025/07/19/luka-doncic-lake‚Ä¶tension-decision/)

The single biggest piece of Los Angeles Lakers business ‚Äî bigger than Jeanie Buss selling the team, bigger than the LeBron James drama, bigger than Austin Reaves‚Äô declined contract extension and bigger than landing a starting center ‚Äî has yet to occur.

Luka Donƒçiƒá, who became the face of the Lakers‚Äô present and future the moment Rob Pelinka and the organization shocked the NBA by acquiring him from Dallas last February, is eligible to sign a contract extension with the franchise on Aug. 2.

While Donƒçiƒá hasn‚Äôt directly addressed his future with the franchise this summer ‚Äî time he‚Äôs spent in Europe putting together an all-time revenge glow-up ‚Äî his actions behind the scenes crystalize why the Lakers are confident with how things stand.

Donƒçiƒá, according to league sources, had communicated his desires for a capable rim-running center, shooting help and defensive support. The Lakers responded by filling those needs with Deandre Ayton, Jake LaRavia and, soon, Marcus Smart.

1m6p94n,Austin Reaves will be and should be a starter for the Los Angeles Lakers.,"I think this has to be said now with all the posts declaring otherwise. For one, Reaves is like 99% likely to start. There's not much likelihood he doesn't. But it is interesting and fun to speculate. It's the offseason.

For two, Austin Reaves' fit with the starters is not just excellent...it is necessary. There's not that many better third scorers/creators around the league than Reaves and having that third scorer, having a player like Reaves who can provide tertiary playmaking, someone who shoots 40% on C&S 3's and 36% on pull-ups....someone who was an 83rd percentile PnR ballhandler at high leverage. There's a lot of talk on here about reducing Bron's workload yet you wanna play Reaves off the bench which would lead to an increase of Bron's responsibilities offensively.

You need threats around Luka and LeBron offensively. Reaves can generate offense on his own, can create off of Luka and Bron and make plays for others, and can finish what those two set up for him. If there are no threats around Luka and Bron, guess what happens? Defenses titled toward them and forcing the other three players on the floor to make decisions and make plays. Luka Luka Luka offense, as amazing as he is, only goes so far for any team.

Yes, there are defensive questions, but defense is easier to game plan than offense and you now have a POA defender in Smart, a pretty solid defender of forwards in Luka, and a legitimate rim presence in Ayton who has some versatility defensively. The Lakers' defensive scheme that propelled them to a top 10 defense the latter half of last season is a very taxing way to play over the course of an 82 game season. Lakers don't need Reaves to be outstanding....just need him to be manageable, have game plan discipline and function well within the team context and he's capable of doing those things, IMO.

Austin Reaves is a starter, and he will be starting for the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2025/26 season.",RVALover4Life,lakers,36,202,2025-07-22 20:30:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m6p94n/austin_reaves_will_be_and_should_be_a_starter_for/,0,False,False,False,False

1m6bqei,Free agents 2026,"Lakers are going to have a lot of cap space next year. As of now there are several players that would be very helpful. I strongly believe it is better to sign several good players, rather than delusionally hoping for a star.

Isaiah Hartenstein - he has a team option, but considering contracts of SGA, Jalen Williams and Chet, OKC may very well let him walk. Hartenstein is a fantastic center and would be a great addition.

PJ Washington - Mavs have a log jam in the front court. and their salary situation is not that great, so he may very well walk. A fantastic, switchable defender who can also hit a 3 and attack the rim. A proven perfect fit with Luka. He should definitely be a target next year.

Andrew Wiggins - he has a player option, but will probably decline it for a longer deal. Great 2 way player with championship experience. If not by a trade, he should be another target for signing.

Mikal Bridges - he will probably be re-signed, but Knicks also have several big contracts that might make it difficult to retain him. He would be a perfect fit for Luka.

Keon Ellis - another perfect fit. Should be a target.

1m6pg4l,Western Conference Summer League Notes from Keith Smith of Spotrac (Lakers Notes in Text),"On the offseason moves (Note: this conversation was before the reported Marcus Smart agreement): ‚ÄúWe came in without much room under the first apron and with some needs. We feel like we did great, considering the lack of tools to do much. Deandre (Ayton) fills a massive need, but literally and figuratively. Jake (LaRavia) gives us shooting with size. Look at all the best teams, they have shooting with size. And we‚Äôre really excited about getting Adou (Thiero) in the draft too. He‚Äôs going to get better quickly, because he‚Äôll be going against great players every day,‚Äù a Lakers front office executive said.

On LeBron James: ‚ÄúWhenever you sign a player to a deal with an option, you willing give them the control to initially guide the situation. But this notion that a player option gives the player all of the power, is pretty silly. If they opt out, the team is then a partner in re-signing them or not. If they opt in, then the team is a partner in whatever happens next too. For LeBron, he had a player option and made his decision to opt in. We‚Äôre just happy that he‚Äôs still a Laker,‚Äù a Los Angeles front office executive said.

On extending Luka Doncic: ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt even allowed to do that until next month (August 2nd), so it‚Äôs a bit early to talk about that. But Luka and his reps know how we feel about him. They‚Äôve known that since we‚Äôve traded for him. This will hopefully be a long, long partnership between Luka and us,‚Äù a Lakers front office executive said.

On the roster now (Note: this conversation was before the reported Marcus Smart agreement): ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still working on some tweaks. I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôre done. We‚Äôd like to add a little more depth. But we feel pretty good about our roster now. Good versatility, better depth up front, added some shooting. The front office still has some things coming, so we‚Äôll see what it looks like when camp starts,‚Äù a Lakers coach said.

In the playoffs, timberwolves attacked AR more than Luka, because of his lack of strength to contest slashers (J daniel, AE, hell; even dante)

he‚Äôd be a great if he can add on 5-10 lbs this summer‚Ä¶

1m6tu64,Do y‚Äôall think it would‚Äôve been better to keep Goodwin and sign Okogie to the vet min or to still get Smart,"Idk if Okogie was even an option but I ask cause none of them really provide much on offense but you get more depth with 2 guys instead of one(who are also younger). Smart is a good secondary playmaker but with 3 playmakers on the team idk how useful that skill is. Lastly, hopefully he doesn‚Äôt, but there is an injury risk there which could‚Äôve been mitigated by having 2 guys. The last roster spot can‚Äôt be filled either now because of the first apron. Seemed like Luka wanted so him so maybe that‚Äôs the most important aspect",North-Huckleberry289,lakers,0,16,2025-07-22 23:37:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m6tu64/do_yall_think_it_wouldve_been_better_to_keep/,0,False,False,False,False
1m6dkrk,Can you imagine if LeBron joined Kobe to learn to win in 2010 instead of Wade?,"Let‚Äôs say it happens. The Lakers trade Bynum and Odom in a sign-and-trade. You get:
	‚Ä¢	Kobe (age 32)
	‚Ä¢	LeBron (age 25)
	‚Ä¢	Pau (still elite)
	‚Ä¢	Maybe a couple of ring-chasing vets
That team probably wins at least 1 or 2 titles. Kobe gets his 6th or 7th ring. LeBron develops that killer instinct earlier. Maybe he doesn‚Äôt leave L.A. and stays for a decade. But maybe‚Ä¶ he also never gets the keys to a team until Kobe retires. That could stunt his leadership arc.

1m60al8,I have a trade idea,"I know that rumours are saying we are going after jrue holiday so I have a trade idea

Lakers get:
Holiday, Camara and Robert Williams + maybe another vet min

Blazers get:
Reaves, Vanderbilt, kleber, Vincent and knecht + a second

Blazers get off the jrue contract with expirings and get a new borderline all star, we get a bunch of defence to win now and move on. Who says no",ProfessionalCat2770,lakers,0,41,2025-07-22 00:50:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m60al8/i_have_a_trade_idea/,0,False,False,False,False
