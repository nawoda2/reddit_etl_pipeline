1m5d8rq,the Lebron disrespect has gotten crazy,"Man, I get that Lebron's retirement is imminent, but the disrespect should stop. 

I haven't been a Laker fan since birth, but what I do know is that Lebron brought relevance, competitiveness, and a chip after the dark years. Sure, that was a couple of years back already.

But the man, even at 40, finished 6th in MVP voting, 2nd All-NBA team, and is still posting career-highs. 

Most of y'all are spoiled as hell. We got Luka now, sure. But whatever happened to the LA Lakers treats its stars well mantra they used to put out there to attract top FAs?

Arguably the GOAT, surely top 3, and as days have gone by, you see multiple posts and comments like:  
\- Trade LeBron (+Bronny even lmao)  
\- LeBron should step into a lesser role (he tried giving AD the keys)

1m591l6,[Stein] The recent Dončić pitch particularly resonated with Smart and helped him choose the Lakers over a determined push by the Suns. Smart has been working hard on his body this summer. The Lakers were convinced during their pursuit that they will see a sleeker version of the 2021-22 DPOY.,"Soon to begin his (whoa) eighth NBA season, Dončić was a lead recruiter in the Lakers' pursuits of Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart via the NBA's increasingly robust July buyout market.

I'm told that the recent Dončić pitch, once Washington granted the 31-year-old and his agent Jason Glushon permission to talk to other teams in search of a post-buyout landing spot, particularly resonated with Smart and helped lead the former Defensive Player of the Year to choose the Lakers over a determined push by the Suns to land the former Celtic.

I'm likewise told that Smart (like Dončić) has been working hard on his body this summer. Conditioning was an undeniable issue for Smart last season, but the Lakers were convinced during their pursuit that they will see a sleeker version of the 2021-22 DPOY.

I'm also hearing Jarred Vanderbilt is healthier now than he was at any point last season, which will naturally spark hope that the versatile forward seems like an offseason addition himself when training camp opens in late September. Ditto for Maxi Kleber, who made only one appearance — for five minutes in Game 5 of the Lakers' first-round exit to Minnesota — after he was shipped to Lakerland with Dončić on Feb. 2.

External fretting about Dončić committing his long-term future to the Lakers, meanwhile, has dissipated considerably thanks to the contributions made by the 26-year-old throughout free agency in collaboration with vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka. Contact between Pelinka, Dončić and two pillars of Team Luka — chief brand officer and business manager Lara Beth Seager and longtime agent Bill Duffy — has been constant since a well-chronicled dinner at Craig's in West Hollywood shortly after L.A.'s first-round playoff elimination that The Stein Line first reported on below in early May.",Odd-Direction9452,lakers,456,63,2025-07-21 04:05:14,https://open.substack.com/pub/marcstein/p/sunday-best-the-latest-hottest-and?r=1m9zg&utm_medium=ios,0.99,False,False,False,False

1m580cv,Let’s roll with this squad,"C - Ayton/Hayes

F - Lebron/Rui/LaRavia/Vando/Kleber/Adiou

G - Luka/Reaves/Vincent/Smart/Knecht/Bronny

I still believe we will make a move at the deadline but I’m honestly fine with the roster as is.  Yes we’d like another 3-D wing but let’s not discount internal growth and well designed scheme.  We filled two key needs going into the offseason: starting caliber center in Ayton, POA defender in Smart and we managed to not lose a wing by swapping DFS for LaRavia.  I’m hoping guys start working on their games starting now, seems like vacations are ending and guys will be back in the gym.  Vando needs a corner 3, LaRavia and Bronny and Reaves need to learn from Smart on how to be smarter defenders.  I like the team we have constructed, it’s not perfect but it’s better than last year’s team by virtue of simply having a starting center.  We have a Big 3 that each averaged 20+ ppg and 5+ APG in the second half of last season.

I’m not call us favorites (that’s OKC by default) but I think we are in the thick of it and can contend with the right scheme. 

Getting excited for October to roll around again.  We got a 3 seed with no true center for half the year and an out of shape Luka. Let’s see what we can do now.

Even when he was on the Celtics, you had to respect that he was playing harder than anyone else on the floor. To know why? Powerful stuff that makes him easy to root for. 

Another upside is that he could be crucial to Bronny’s development. He has slightly longer measurements, but they have very similar physicals as strong/short guards in height/weight/wingspan. He can teach Bronny a lot about how to be effective with that build. ",tizzy713,lakers,54,4,2025-07-21 18:26:57,https://youtube.com/shorts/pek-qU9pmSg?si=P3PdIQA32bIUJKEc,0.97,False,False,False,False

1m5llag,"G League, Two-way and Exhibit 10 rules","After reading a lot of posts many are confused about how these rules work for players and teams. Here are the basics on each of these.

The rules for G League players primarily revolve around their status with NBA teams, including standard contract players, two-way players, and assignment players, with G League teams also having their own roster and player eligibility rules. G League players are eligible for various types of contracts, including the ability to sign with NBA parent clubs. 
Players under standard G League contracts are essentially free agents and can be signed by any NBA team. However, two-way players are under contract with a specific NBA team and can only be signed by that team. Additionally, players on assignment from an NBA team to the G League are still under contract with that NBA team and can be recalled at any time. 

G League Standard NBA Contract Players:

NBA teams can assign players with less than three years of NBA service to their G League affiliate, who remain on the NBA roster and can be recalled at any time. Players with more service time may also use the G League for injury rehabilitation. 
NBA teams can retain up to four players they waive from their training camp rosters, designating them as ""affiliate players"" who are then automatically allocated to that team's G League affiliate if they sign a G League contract. 
So basically out of 13 spots on a G League team the parent club can basically protect 7 players from other teams trying to poach them.

Two-Way players

Eligibility:
Two-way contracts are for players with three or fewer years of NBA service.
Each NBA team can have up to three players on two-way contracts. 
Playing Time:
Players on two-way contracts can spend up to 50 games with their NBA team during the regular season. 
They spend the rest of the season with their G League affiliate. 
Compensation:
Two-way contracts pay a pro-rated portion of the rookie minimum salary (half the value for 2025-26). 
The contracts can be partially guaranteed, with a portion of the salary guaranteed if the player isn't waived before the start of the regular season. 
Players can also have their contracts converted to standard NBA deals, with the salary becoming the NBA minimum for their years of service. 
Postseason:
Two-way players are generally not eligible for the NBA playoffs. 
However, they can become eligible if their contract is converted to a standard NBA deal before the start of the playoffs. 
Other Notable Points:
Two-way contracts do not count against the salary cap for the NBA team. 
The NBA introduced two-way contracts in the 2017 offseason to help teams develop young players. 
Teams can offer these contracts to players who have not yet accumulated significant NBA experience. 

Exhibit 10 contracts

Minimum Salary: Exhibit 10 contracts are typically for the league minimum salary. 
Non-Guaranteed: These contracts are not guaranteed, meaning a team can waive a player without financial penalty before the regular season begins. 
Training Camp Invite: Exhibit 10 contracts are a common way for teams to bring players to training camp to compete for a roster spot. 
Conversion to Two-Way Contract: The contract can be converted to a two-way contract (allowing the player to play for both the NBA team and its G League affiliate) before the start of the regular season. 
Exhibit 10 Bonus: If the player is waived and then signs with the team's G League affiliate, they can earn a bonus (typically between $5,000 and $50,000). 
G League Affiliate: The bonus incentivizes the player to sign with the team's G League affiliate, allowing the team to retain their rights and develop them. 
Limited to Six: Teams can have a maximum of six Exhibit 10 contracts at any given time. 

Kind of a lot to sift through but gives the basics on each. Another thing to think about is any player that signs a standard G League contract as a free agent with any G league team is free to sign with any NBA team at any time. They are basically free agents playing in the G League.",Large_Leading_4985,lakers,8,4,2025-07-21 15:14:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m5llag/g_league_twoway_and_exhibit_10_rules/,0.73,False,False,False,False
1m5sitv,Rui’s Future (2027 plan),"I know this is looking a little bit into the future but where does rui stand with the so called 2027 off season plan? I would love to keep rui on the team but do we really see him taking a 1 year deal to stay on the lakers next off season? I say this because there is just enough cap space to sign a max (35%) free agent with the current salaries on the books in 2027-2028 plus Luka and Austin. I’m not exactly sure what the off season plan in that year would be but it doesn’t make sense for the lakers to not have that cap space open given how much has come out about the 2027 off season. Do you guys think that they commit to Rui and lose some flexibility in 2027 or trade/lose him in FA. This isn’t even accounting for if Deandre resigns which makes the situation even tighter. I haven’t really seen much discourse around Rui in the context of the 2027 off season so please correct me if I’m wrong or if there are other options to keep him!

TL;DR: Ruis next contract would prevent some of the flexibility they’ve been focusing on for 2027, will they try to keep flexibility/trade him or commit to him and lose out on the 35% cap slot that they will barely have when Luka and Austin resign.

The Brett Seigel article re: the Lakers desire to keep Goodwin mentioned teams putting the squeeze on the Lakers knowing their straits in wanting to keep Goodwin but lacking flexibility. However I do think this is a deal the Nets would accept with a pick attached. Lakers would have a lot of flexibility in-season to make roster changes with this trade and Martin is a non-guaranteed minimum salary...his contract would have to be guaranteed for the trade but he likely gets immediately bought out. 

This is the kind of deal I think is realistic for the Lakers involving an expiring of theirs. You'd have space to make two additions to the roster from there or keep the final spot open if they so choose.

1m57uz8,"Is this roster better than Houston, OKC, and Denver?","With the Goodwin waiver, it looks like this is the final roster until the season starts. The other 11 teams in the West either weren't particularly good or have gotten weaker, so I think the biggest threats in the West right now are OKC, Houston, and Denver. 

With Houston and Denver, I think LA is clearly better. As a first option, Luka is as good as Jokic and better than KD. LeBron is also better as a second option than Sengun or Murray. As for the role players in the starting lineup, Reaves/Ayton/Rui is a strong trio and I think they're better than Amen/FVV/Tari or Gordon/Cam/Braun. While our bench is pretty sparse, so is theirs so it's advantage Lakers.

With OKC specifically, they have a lot of young players who will have improved. I think OKC would still be favored against LA, but LA would have a solid (let's say 40%) shot to beat them in a series. Luka and LeBron are still a great duo, and we've shored up our biggest weaknesses and gotten Luka an actual center. 

I think this roster is a solid top 3 roster in the West, and while we might not be favorites we have a solid shot to win a ring.

1m5asl2,"I really like our depth now, but LeBron has to play a lesser role in regular season","For us to make a serious run in the playoff.

He is 41, he has to save his legs as much as possible.

Ideally he takes a back seat this season and just play 25 mins a game.

And leave the offensive duties to Luka and AR.

This is a young man game.

Lebron can only play at a high level in limited number of games. I prefer that to be in the playoff.

And LeBron last year number were deceiving.

But he had his worst +/-.

This is not a coincidence, he had much worst team before.

Basketball is game of inches and if LeBron pick his spot to play defense, it trickle down to the effectiveness of the whole team.  LeBron unable to play with full effort is very bad for our team.

I hope LeBron and JJ can realize this and have LeBron take a back seat in regular season, so he can save his legs for playoff.",Nonameheroz,lakers,0,37,2025-07-21 05:44:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1m5asl2/i_really_like_our_depth_now_but_lebron_has_to/,0.22,False,False,False,False
