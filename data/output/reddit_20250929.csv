1nspxas,We are LeBron days away from the start of the regular season,,WayAdministrative679,lakers,266,5,2025-09-28 14:36:31,https://i.redd.it/3qj1eerr2xrf1.jpeg,0.98,False,False,False,False
1nspevx,"April 20, 1999 - The final seconds of regulation of a game where the Lakers trailed the Warriors by 28, Kobe drills a three and then tips in a missed free throw to send the game into overtime. He finished with 27 points, 25 after halftime, as the Lakers went on to win 106-102.","The first season I started watching the Lakers was during the 98-99 lockout campaign, their last before Phil arrived. I remember seeing highlights of this game as a 9-year-old and being absolutely stunned at the way they came back. Shaq got ejected in the second quarter, so this is one of the first times Kobe basically said, ""I'm driving the bus and we're winning this f\*\*\*ing game.""

  
Tragically, this was also the day of the Columbine High School Massacre; Chick Hearn voiced his belief that all games that day should have been postponed.

1nswm6m,Jarred Vanderbilt's Rookie Draft Scouting Report,"""**Outlook:** Vanderbilt is a prototypical point forward very similar to Lamar Odom. His ability to rebound at an incredibly high rate and then lead the break could have a drastic impact on his team and its offensive efficiency. He is capable of using his height to see over and around defenders while running his team’s offense. If he is healthy, he will likely drastically outperform his draft position. However, there is significant risk in taking him due to the injury history. He could become a starter for a playoff team or play only 50 games in his career and neither would be overly surprising.""

This same report said his shot mechanics were ""not broken, but need to be refined to improve his jumper""

Two things jump out at me reading this:

1: Whoever worked with Vando on his shot mechanics after he entered the league needs to be fired.

2: We've seen him flash skill as a short roller and cutter when used right within the offense. If he can remember how to handle the ball and finish at the rim the way he did before his injury, this Lakers team is going to surprise a lot of people.

1nsrk3g,"LeBron, CP3, and Lowry historic seasons","I read somewhere that this will be the first time in league history, that there will be three active players playing in their 20th or more season in the league. LeBron will play in his 23rd, CP3 in his 21st, and Kyle Lowry in his 20th. A truly remarkable stat.  
A true testament to how far medicine, training, diet, and everything in between has gone since the 1980s and the 1990s.",AlekDailyTailCom,lakers,23,12,2025-09-28 15:42:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1nsrk3g/lebron_cp3_and_lowry_historic_seasons/,0.88,False,False,False,False
1nszjsv,The Lakers front office are making the right choices. Here's why.,"The key is that championship teams are built little by little. Every year a new element to the team is developed and the team grows little by little.

Obviously the 2020 Lakers are a case against this philosophy but is it really too far fetched?

Much of the key contributing rotation players on that team developed chemistry the year before. That is LeBron, KCP, Rondo, Kuzma, Alex Caruso. Then the Lakers added Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard, Markieff and Danny Green. Don't get me wrong the WHOLE TEAM WAS ESSENTIAL AND GREAT. The same goes for the 2009 Lakers and many other teams. And you can see what happened to other teams that didn't have time like the 2011 Heat, 2015 Cavs. 2021 Nets etc.

All I'm trying to say is that I believe in what our front office is trying to do. Dynasties and all great successes take time. Let's do it one step at a time. We got our core LeBron, Luka, Rui, AR, Hayes, Gabe, Knecht, Vando. We added key pieces in Ayton, Smart,  LaRavia, and Thiero. Let's keep building, maybe we can make a mid season trade if necessary.

Who is to say that our players have not developed this off-season? Players constantly develop at all points in the career as was the case with Dwight Howard. Who's to say that this season isn't different that last year?
