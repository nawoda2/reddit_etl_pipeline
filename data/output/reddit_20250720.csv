1m4btsi,I honestly think we're a chip contender now,"So here's my thinking, we have a good chance of winning a championship this year if everyone stays healthy and motivated. I'd love to hear your opinion in the comments.

Luka : We literally have luka freakin doncic, who is known to preform and hustle even when injured. He can make teammates around him better and has already carried the mavs to the finals, and to the wcf when they were worse. 

Lebron : Despite his age, he is still a top 10 player in the league and will most likely still perform amazing this year. 

Austin : An amazing regular season player thar has improved immensely, if he manages to keep it on this level and later on pushes hard in the playoffs he will make a difference. 

Rui : A great 3&D, i love him more every season and i think he brings alot to the table. 

Ayton : While he is known to have poor motivation and motor, he will now play alongside luka, that will make him better and love playing again. He was awesome with CP3 and i think he can do that again, on another level even. 

Marcus : Great player, much needed defender, if he stays healthy he'll bring fire to the floor. 

Laravia : Young, with much more room to grow and a great guard addition, almost on the same level as DFS. 

Bronny : Has improved alot this year and will continue to grow. If he succeeds in being a defensive pest and improving his shot he will add something meaningful to the team, subbing out for 10 minutes/night. 

Hayes : Great backup, ayton will be taking his minutes so as a C rotation he will perform to the level that is expected of a backup C. 

Adou : Athletic freak, could be a great 3&D once his shot settles from the growth spurt. Feeling confident in him.

The others i don't really believe in much anymore, that's why a trade to extend bench deepth is needed. But i still honestly think we can do something big, with this year's additions.
