1o2r9ne,Luka Hot One interview highlights/summary for anyone who didn't watch,"Full Hot Ones Interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzwBq7rvdrM

- For the weight-watchers yes he did go back for a second bite of the first wing 

- Haha he asked Luka what workout hed recommend a beginner and Luka laughed sheepishly and said he should ask his trainer (though he later said planks are good)

- Luka says theres way more trash talk in the NBA compared to Europe

- In Europe, he names Serbia, Greece, and Turkey as having the best crowd atmospheres. Toughest crowd he played against was vs Panathinaikos

- Potential Slovenian dish/snack to serve in NBA arenas: Luka doesnt think any really fit, maybe something sweet though like cremeschnitte (kinda like a vanilla slice from google)

- Kyrie apparently tries crazy ballhandling moves in practice that he doesn't in games; he tried teaching Luka some moves but he wasn't really successful

- ‚ÄúYou like spicy?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou like basketball?‚Äù - great exchange hahah

- Luka and Sean have nice chemistry it's a very cute interview, they're both super chill and down-to-earth

- Apparently Luka went viral when shittalking a famous overwatch streamer once

- A game which defined Luka's childhood: Medal of Honour of PS2

- Luka plays chess apparently, TIL, makes sense

- Lmao Luka just swore in Serbian/Croatian(?) after trying Da Bomb and said ""Oh sorry, that means Good Morning"" üòÇüòÇ

- He was handling the wings well but it's all unraveling now, 2nd glass of milk unwrapped

- & JULIET(?) is one of his favourite Broadway shows

- Luka sometimes warms up to Britney songs before games; favourite: Oops I Did It Again

- Luka wouldn't be opposed to having a small part on the Mamma Mia theatre production 

- Fave Disney original movie: HSM. Fave song: Get Your Head In The Game

- Who would Luka nominate for a 1 on 1 tourney: Wemby because you can't score on him, Kyrie

- Luka's end-credit promos: ""Buy Luka 4s. And 77s. And Lakers jersey""

- Turned down ice-cream at the end, respect",KagsTheOneAndOnly,lakers,97,25,2025-10-10 04:20:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1o2r9ne/luka_hot_one_interview_highlightssummary_for/,0.9,False,False,False,False,2025-10-11,2025,10,10

1o306aw,"Looking at the schedule, the Lakers can afford LeBron to rest","The most important thing for the Lakers is getting to the playoffs fresh and healthy. And with LeBron scheduled to miss some time, the good news is that the schedule is kind in the beginning. It's not until late November that they start getting tough games after tough games. Yes, there are teams like Minnesota and San ANtonio and Atlanta, but the first few weeks the Lakers also play Portland twice, Sacramento (a complete mess), Charlotte, Miami, New Orleans, and they have a back to back against Utah in the end of November.  
Luka is more than capable of carrying this team to a winning record in the first three to four weeks. The Lakers need LeBron healthy, and my assumption is he will play between 45 and 55 games this season.",AlekDailyTailCom,lakers,37,50,2025-10-10 12:57:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1o306aw/looking_at_the_schedule_the_lakers_can_afford/,0.78,False,False,False,False,2025-10-11,2025,10,10

1o3dw2o,Did people just forgot how attrocious Vando was next to Luka last season?,"In recent days/weeks, I saw multiple posts and commets about Vando having a bigger role in the rotation, or even starting. I'm on the polar opposite, I don't want Vando the share the court with Luka even for a minute.

In general, Luka needs finishers, and player who can extend an advantage around him, and Vando is neither. He was bad finishing at the rim (56%), and attrotious from 3 (28%), and he's not Draymond to compensate for those with fast and accurate decisionmaking and passing (1.1 ast to 0.8 tov in 16 minutes). Last season, in 1505 possession with Luka on court and Vando on the bench, the Lakers had an offensive rating of 123.3, elite territory. With Luka and Vando both playing in 490, it dropped to 117,8, still an above average number, but a 5.5 point drop is worth around 12 wins over a season!

To make things worst, these numbers were mainly reached by playing Vando at the 5, i.e. with 3 shooters and him in the dunker spot around Luka. When a center was on the court too (Hayes, Jemison, Koloko), the offensive rating dropped to 105, which is league worst level and unplayable. This came with a tradeoff on the defensive side too, since Vando at 5 meant no rim protection or defensive rebounding, resulting in a worse defensive rating by 4 points.

Considering that this season the Lakers can put 48 minutes of rim protection and rim rolling on the court, but at least 32 minutes of Ayton, I don't see a scenario where playing Vando is playing more than 10-14 minutes effectively.",Baluba95,lakers,0,23,2025-10-10 21:39:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1o3dw2o/did_people_just_forgot_how_attrocious_vando_was/,0.36,False,False,False,False,2025-10-11,2025,10,10
1o2ppk6,Some observations,"Ayton
I was so hyped when they got him for nothing. He looks like he is over basketball and is collecting a check. He reminds me of Mo Bamba last year with the Clippers. Hope I am wrong, but Jaxson Hayes is looking like the starting center right now.

Nick Smith Jr.
Damn this guy looks good. How is Bronny James ahead of him on the depth chart? Oh wait...forget I asked. When I had 3000 budget left in daily fantasy...this was a guy to use it on cause he could blow up when fed the ball...which leads me to the next point.

Gabe Vincent
Looks awesome but he always does...why does it translate to a good game like 5 times a season with the Lakers...has to be the system right?

Maxi Kleber
He has really gotten in shape. If he stays healthy...he might be our 5 with Hayes.

LaRavia is that guy on the court who gets picked last but is capable of putting up all 21 in a game.

Luka looks unbelievable. The best basketball player on earth is on a mission and it shows.

I would sacrifice this season to keep Reaves. I dont care how bad our 5 situation gets. This guy is a star and still participates in the entire practice.

As I am writing this as news is breaking that LeBron is out for a month...as much as I would love to watch one of his last years...business is 1st...if the Warriors want him and will part with Kuminga and a 1st..let's do it and throw in Tommy...I mean Bronny boy ",whatthepluxk,lakers,0,34,2025-10-10 03:00:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1o2ppk6/some_observations/,0.17,False,False,False,False,2025-10-11,2025,10,10
