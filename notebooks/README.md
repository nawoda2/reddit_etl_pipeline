- Ensure the database credentials are correct

### Missing Tables
- Run the ETL pipeline first to populate the database
- Check the Airflow logs for any data loading errors
- Verify the pipeline completed successfully

### Package Installation Issues
- Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
- Try using a virtual environment
- Check your internet connection

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
